# 🎵 Music Soul

**Music Soul** is a web application feature that integrates pleasant ambient background music into user-facing screens to elevate the user experience (UX). Designed with modern web standards and user preferences in mind, it provides seamless, non-disruptive playback during idle or browsing periods, with intelligent triggers and user-centric controls.

## ✨ Features

- **Music Playback**: Soft ambient music plays automatically on welcome and browsing screens.  
- **Smart Triggers**: Playback activates during long content loads and pauses during focused tasks or when other media is active.  
- **User Controls**: Users can pause/play, mute/unmute, and adjust volume through intuitive UI elements.  
- **Preferences Memory**: Remembers user settings (volume, mute state) across sessions.  
- **Admin Content Management**: Easily update playlists seasonally or thematically via CMS—no code required.  
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures seamless audio integration without degrading page performance.
